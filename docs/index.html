							<h1>Welcome incoming students!</h1>
							<p>This page is to help prepare incoming students starting one of three MSc programs in the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology: <b>Environmental Engineering</b>, <b>Civil Engineering</b> and <b>Applied Earth Sciences</b>.</p>
                            <p>Below you will find a list of resources to help you prepare for the start of your program. These resources are not mandatory, but are recommended to help you get the year off to a good start, particularly in the module Modeling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers (MUDE), which is required for students in all three programs. Students who did these short courses in the summer felt much prepared for MUDE in September!</p>
                            <p>At minimum, we recommend working through two online courses: <b>Python</b> and <b>Probability and Statistics</b> as a refresher from your BSc program. <em>If you have never taken a course on either of these topics in your BSc program,</em> you should take one of the online courses listed in the Additional Resources section. If you are unfamiliar with Python or coding in general, we strongly recommend doing at least the 'Programming in Python' course and at least one of the other Python courses under 'Additional Resources'</p>

									<h2>Programming in Python</h2>
									<p>From the beginning of the academic year you will be using the Python programming language intensively. If you have never used Python before, but have used another scientific computing language (e.g., Matlab), we strongly encourage you to follow our online course <a href="https://teachbooks.github.io/learn-python/intro.html">Python for Engineers</a>. Even if you have used Python before, the online course is an excellent refresher. If you have never programmed in <em>any</em> language before, you should also use the additional Python resources provided below.</p>
                                    <p>How can you tell if you should take the refresher course? You should be comfortable using any of the following concepts:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Common data types (int, float, strings, boolean)</li>
                                        <li>Variables, Constants, Operators and Expressions</li>
                                        <li>Basic data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets</li>
                                        <li>if/then/else statements</li>
                                        <li>Loops</li>
                                        <li>Functions</li>
                                        <li>Basic plotting with matplotlib</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In addition, familiarity with the Python library Numpy is also useful:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Basic Numpy operations: addition, subtraction multiplication, division, dot product, matrix multiplication</li>
                                        <li>Numpy arrays: 1-D, 2-D and N-D arrays, array creation</li>
                                        <li>Array manipulation: sorting, indexing and slicing, reshaping and transpose, joining arrays</li>
                                    </ul>
